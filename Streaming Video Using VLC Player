Streaming The Camera Video Using RTSP
raspivid -o - -t 0 -n | cvlc -vvv stream:///dev/stdin --sout '#rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8554/}' :demux=h264

Viewing The RTSP Stream Over The Network
You need a player which supports RTSP, for instance VLC, Quicktime, etc.  Open a network stream using

rtsp://###.###.###.###:8554/
where ###.###.###.### is the IP address of the RPi.


raspivid is used to capture the video

"-o -" causes the output to be written to stdout
"-t 0" sets the timeout to disabled
"-n" stops the video being previewed (remove if you want to see the video on the HDMI output)
cvlc is the console vlc player
"-vvv" and its argument specifies where to get the stream from
"-sout" and its argument specifies where to output it to 

Options:
